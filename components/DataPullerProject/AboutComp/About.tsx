          It&apos;s no secret that sites want to know as much as possible about their visitors, whether it&apos;s to
          show them targeted ads or improve their user experience. The goal of this project is to give you an idea about
          types of information that websites can collect and access from you. No matter what the privacy settings of
          your browser are, certain information about you is inevitably revealed to the sites you visit. For example,
          you start sharing your IP address as soon as you go online, which can be used to pinpoint your approximate
          location. note that the information you see above is used to generate your fingerprint, This information is used by websites to build
          a profile of you, which can then be used to target you with ads or to personalize your experience on the
          site.
